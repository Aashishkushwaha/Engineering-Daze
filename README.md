# Contribution Guidelines :gear:

You may go through these guidelines and contribute accordingly:

* Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources like GFG,hackerearth, etc because that work will not be considered. **Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.** 
* If you want to contribute for an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
* If you have modified/added code work, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
* Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in correct folder.
* Just mention the issue against which the pull request is open by writing ```Fixes #(your issue number)``` in the description of the pull request
* Do not update the [README.md](README.md).

## Guidelines for issue creation :
* Always **pitch your idea well** and mention the specific **data structure/algorithm** and the **language** in which you will implement.
* Your issue can be **closed** if the issue you created already exists. Use the search functionality on Github Issues.
* Once you have decided the problem you want to work upon, shoot an issue and patiently wait for our project maintainer to have a look over it and assign it to you.
* You can **ONLY** work on the issues that have been **assigned** to you.

## Guidelines for code base :
* Use **1 tab or 4 spaces** indentation.
* Add the **description** of your algorithm using multi-line comments at the starting of the code.
* Add **comments** to your code in a **new line** and use single-line comments with **1 tab or 4 spaces** indentation.
* Try to make your code **user input**.
* Add **minimum 2 test cases** along with input and output at the end of your code using multi-line comments.
* Also, add **time** and **space complexity** at the end of your code using multi-line comments.

## Where to upload the files üìÇ

* Your files should be uploaded inside the same folder as the question and name your file as **Question_name.cpp** (assuming that the code submitted is written in cpp)
* **Under no circumstances create new folders within the respective topic folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so**.
* Edit the corresponding README.md file to add the link to your code in the corresponding section in **alphabetical order**.[(GitHub Markdown Guide)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).


The value of a strong contribution stays beyond everything and gives you satisfaction.
